Adapter:
    A construct that adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y.

Bridge:
    A mechanism that decouples an interface (hierarchy) from an implementation (hierarchy).
    - decouple abstraction form implementation
    - both can exist as hierarchy
    - a stronger form of encapsulation

Composite:
    A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions objects in a
    uniform manner.
    - Objects can use other objects via inheritance/composition
    - Some composed and singular objects need similar/identical behaviors
    - Composite design pattern let us treat both type of objects uniformly
