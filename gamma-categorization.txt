Creational Patterns
    Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
    Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
    Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step)

Structural Patters
    Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members)
    Many patters are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface
    Stress the importance of good API design

Behavioral Patters
    They are all different; no central theme
