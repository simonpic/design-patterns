Builder:
    When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly.

    - A builder is a separate component for building an object
    - Can either give builder a constructor or return it via a static function
    - Different facets of an object can be built with different builders working in tandem
      via a base class


Factory:
    A component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects


Prototype:
    A partially or fully initialized object that you copy, clone and make use of it


Singleton
    A component which is instantiated only once

    - Making a 'safe' singleton is easy: construct a static Lazy<T> and return its value
    - Singletons are difficult to test
    - Instead of directly using a singleton, consider depending on an abstraction (DIP)
    - Consider defining singleton lifetime in DI container
